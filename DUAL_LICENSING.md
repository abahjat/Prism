# PRISM DUAL LICENSING MODEL

Prism is available under two different licenses, depending on how you intend to use it.

## 1. Open Source License (AGPL-3.0)
If you are building open-source software or are willing to release your source code under the AGPL-3.0 compatible terms, you can use Prism for free.

**Terms Summary:**
- **Copyleft**: If you modify Prism or link to it in a networked service, you must release your *entire application's* source code to users of that service.
- **Attribution**: You must keep copyright notices intact.
- **No Warranty**: The software is provided "as is".

See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the full text.

## 2. Commercial License
If you wish to use Prism in a proprietary application (closed source) and do *not* want to release your source code, you must purchase a Commercial License.

**Benefits:**
- **No Copyleft**: You are not required to share your source code.
- **Legal Indemnity**: (Optional/Dependant on plan) Protection against IP claims.
